the intruction to get access to python 
if youre running a mac it is python3 
else the instruction could be py, py3 or pyhton

this is the way that we interact with the PIP
-m       -from the modules
pip      -name of the module that i want to use
install  -what i want to do.
nameOfTheLibrary 

to create a virtual enviroment, i need to install the virtualenv
py -m pip install virtualenv

then we use the venv library to create virtual enviroments:
py -m venv  nameOfTheFolder

now we need to activate our vitual enviroment

mac: 
source venv/bin/activate

win: 
venv\Scripts\activate
